-We existed without the color of our skin, without nationality, without belonging to any religion... And you called us criminals.  You produced atomic bombs, entered wars, committed murder, cheated and lied to us and tried to make us believe that it was for our benefit and we are still guilty!  Yes, I am a criminal.  My fault is to wonder.  My crime is to judge people for what they say and think, not how they look.  My fault is that I am wiser than you, and you will never forgive me.  I am a hacker and this is my manifesto.  You can stop this individual, but you cannot stop us all.

 Above all, we are all the same.
